# Unraveling the Hidden Dance: An Epistatic Exploration of 15 Million+ SARS-CoV-2 Genomes

This project provides a thorough analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, emphasizing its lesser-known genetic makeup. The primary objective is to study the interactions of mutations in the non-Spike genes of SARS-CoV-2, known as epistasis. Through meticulous data analysis, we hope to decode patterns of simultaneous mutations and their combined effect on the virus's evolutionary trajectory.

Utilizing cutting-edge data analysis methodologies, our ambition is to uncover concealed interactions that could clarify the virus's properties, such as adaptability, transmission speed, and resistance against certain treatments. By harnessing machine learning, we aspire to craft models that predict the consequences these mutations might have on the virus, potentially informing upcoming evolution patterns.

A conclusive report and presentation will be crafted at the project's end, summarizing the crucial findings which could significantly aid our approach against future viral pandemics.
